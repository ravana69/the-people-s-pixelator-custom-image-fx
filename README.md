# The People's Pixelator (custom image FX)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/sweaver2112/pen/YzGzXye](https://codepen.io/sweaver2112/pen/YzGzXye).

Custom, stylized image graphics with your favorite colors!

A desktop or laptop computer is recommended.

How it Works:

Colors are assigned by brightness, so whatever color is chosen for "Dark" would be assigned to the darkest pixels in the original image.  These threshold values can be tweaked.

Usage Tips:

Lower Pixel Size To Analyze values will take a long time to render, but be more detailed.

Result Scale can always scale the result up, but it can only scale down when using Pixel Size To Analyze > 1.

Stroke and Dots modes are slower and should be used with higher pixel sizes.
